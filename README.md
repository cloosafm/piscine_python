# Piscine Python for Data Science
The goal of the piscine Python is to get a grasp of the language, its concepts and tools, for data science.

## Day 0 : "Starting"
First, we dive into the basic aspects of the language : syntax, types, data structures, formatting.
We also learn to make a decorator much like tqdm, and to make our own packages.

## Day 1 : "Array"
This day is an introduction to 2 libraries : 
	- NumPy for arrays and matrices
	- PIL/Pillow for image processing
We also make some use of Matplotlib for its visualization capabilities

## Day 2 : "DataTable"
We start with some light data manipulation using Pandas, including handling data from external files.
Then we use Matplotlib to create plots in order to visualize these sets of data.

## Day 3 : "OOP"
No more libraries! Now we delve into object-oriented programming.
This means class creation, magic/dunder methods and use of decorators.

## Day 4 : "DoD"
This is the last day of this piscine, focused on data-oriented design.
We look into how data is accessed, by using wrapper functions and dataclass.
